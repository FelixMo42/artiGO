### Robot

We are using an arduino redBoard to control four motors. For input we are using five ultra sonic sensors. We are printing the body of the bot with a 3d printer.

### The Environment

To train to AI we built a virtual environment in python using gym. The bot is represented by a square and the target a circle.
